/*
I do not believe we can have negative values in our intcode system
Such CONSTRAINTS NEED to be maintain using a semantic database
And must be enforced using metamorphic relations

The potential issue this solves is allowing programers to build
functions based of changing constraints

A solution that does not make this assumption would be more robust
But also more naive and likely less efficient 

//

Write a python scripts that handles generating the uml or semantic stuff
as well as compiliation?

Hopefully I can find a c++ library that can help with the metamorphic testing?
I think users should mostly write there own test but we could definelty create some
"template" ones such as a no_negative?

Dependencies is also a big deal

TWO main categories 
    input and output constraints
    symmetric and what not also 

combines C++ - OWL Turtle - protege

I also want a way to generate documention
Extract cpp code from it or have it inside comments?
I would like to make it 

I want to practice combining these methods before
